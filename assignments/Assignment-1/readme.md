## Introduction
This repository hosts the assignments and project for the Digital Image Processing course at North South University. The assignments involve implementing image effects such as Posterization, Nightvision, Photocopy, Vignetting, and Mirror Image using MATLAB. The code, along with explanations and visualizations, is provided to demonstrate the understanding and application of digital image processing concepts.

## Methodology
The methodology section describes the steps taken to implement each image effect. It covers the logic behind each effect, code implementation, and a general overview of the techniques employed. Check out the [Methodology Section](methodology.md) for detailed explanations.

## Experiment
In the experiment section, we delve into the implementation of each effect and present the results. MATLAB code, along with explanations and visualizations, is provided for each effect. To see the transition from input to output images and the impact of each effect, visit the [Experiment Section](experiment.md).

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository.
3. Browse the individual effect folders to find MATLAB scripts for each effect.
4. Run the MATLAB scripts to see the input, intermediate, and output images.

## Results
The results folder contains visualizations of the transition from input to output images for each effect. Check out the images in the [Results Folder](results/) to see the effects in action.

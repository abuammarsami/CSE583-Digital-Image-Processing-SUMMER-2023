# Assignment 1: Image Effects Implementation

Welcome to Assignment 1 of the Digital Image Processing course at North South University! In this assignment, we dive into the world of image effects, bringing your images to life with fascinating transformations.

## What's Inside?

- `base code/`: The heart of your transformations, where MATLAB magic happens.
  - `input/`: Your image playground, filled with images to be transformed.
  - `output/`: The gallery of your masterpiece transformations.
  - `sampleIN-OUT/`: Your compass - sample input and expected output for guidance.

## Transformations Unleashed

Prepare to be amazed! We've unleashed an array of image effects to mesmerize you:
1. **Posterization**: Adding a touch of pop-art style to your images.
2. **Nightvision**: See the world through the eyes of night vision technology.
3. **Photocopy**: Copying images like a photocopier, but with a twist.
4. **Vignetting**: Embrace the dramatic spotlight effect in your images.
5. **Mirror Image**: Reflect and multiply your images in a mirror realm.

## Get Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the `base_code/` directory and witness the code magic.
3. Execute MATLAB scripts to see transformations unfold before your eyes.
4. Witness the output images appear in the `output/` gallery.

## See It in Action: Before & After ✨
